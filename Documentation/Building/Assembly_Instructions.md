# Steps

If you haven't built the [syringe pump](https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/Syringe_Pump) please reference the GitHub page for instructions on how to assemble the syringe pump.

1. Purchase all of the parts from the [Bills of Materials](Bill_of_Materials)
1. 3D print all the necessary [parts](Frame)
1. Assemble the syringe pump body by following the directions found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067217300822#!). Please
refer to [troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) for any problems that you encounter as we discovered a few quirks with the assembly described in the paper.
1. Remove the plug from the 3D printer extruder stepper motor
