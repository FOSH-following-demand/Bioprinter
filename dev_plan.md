# Bioprinter plan

The components from the syringe pump will be incorporated into a readily available DIY 3D printer. This syringe pump will be able to integrated with the printer's code with minimal modifications.

We will then work on creating a guide to help others start bioprinting and then troubleshooting their prints.
